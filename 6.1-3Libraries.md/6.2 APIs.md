## Working with APIs

Application Programming Interfaces, are a set of rules and protocols for building and interacting with software applications. APIs can be used to interact with other software components.

Hereâ€™s a simple example using the requests module to fetch data from a web API:

````python
import requests

response = requests.get('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts')
posts = response.json()

for post in posts[:5]:  # Only print the first 5 posts
    print(post['title'])
````
