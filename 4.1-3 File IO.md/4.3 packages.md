## Packages

package in Python is a way of organizing related modules into a directory hierarchy. For example, a package might include a collection of modules for handling HTTP requests, processing text, or connecting to a database.

To use a package, you’ll first need to install it (if it’s not part of the Python standard library) using pip:

````python
pip install requests
````

You can then import the package or specific components from it:

````python
import requests
response = requests.get("https://www.example.com")
print(response.status_code)
````
