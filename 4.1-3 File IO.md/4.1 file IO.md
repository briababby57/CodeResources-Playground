## File I/O

Python provides built-in functions for creating, reading, updating, and deleting files.

Here’s how you might create a new file and write some text to it:

````python
with open("example.txt", "w") as f:
    f.write("Hello, world!")
And here’s how you might read the text from a file:

with open("example.txt", "r") as f:
    print(f.read())
    ````
