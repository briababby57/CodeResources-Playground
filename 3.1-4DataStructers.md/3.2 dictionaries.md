## Dictionaries

A dictionary is a mutable data type that stores  keys: values pairs. Hereâ€™s an example:

````python
person_dict = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30, "city": "New York"
````

By referring to the key name you can access the items within a dictionary:

````python
print(person_dict["name"]) # Alice
````
