## Inheritance

allows us to define a class that inherits all the methods and properties from another class.

The class from which properties and methods are inherited is called the parent class, and the class that inherits from the parent class is called the child class.

Hereâ€™s an example:

````python
class Student(Person):
    def __init__(self, name, age, grade):
        super().__init__(name, age)
        self.grade = grade

    def introduce(self):
        print(f"Hello, my name is {self.name}, I'm {self.age} years old and I'm in grade {self.grade}.")
````

In this example, Student is a child class that inherits from the Person parent class.
The super().__init__(name, age) call is used to call the __init__ method of the parent class.
