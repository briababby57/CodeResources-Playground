## classes and objects

almost everything is an object, with its properties and methods. A Class is like an object constructor, or a blueprint for creating objects.

Hereâ€™s an example of a class:

````python
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    def greet(self):
        print(f"Hello, my name is {self.name} and I'm {self.age} years old.")
````

The __init__ method is a special method that gets called when an object is created. The self keyword refers to the instance of the class and is used to access variables that belongs to the class.

We can create an object of the Person class like this:

````python
p = Person("Alice", 30)
p.greet() # Prints: Hello, my name is Alice and I'm 30 years old.
````
