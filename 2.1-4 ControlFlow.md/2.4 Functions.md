## Functions

Functions in Python are defined using the def keyword. For example, a function that adds two numbers might look like this:

````python
def add(x, y):
    return x + y
````

You can call this function using its name followed by its arguments in parentheses:

````python
print(add(3, 4))  # Outputs: 7
````
