## If, Elif, Else

__You can use if, elif (short for “else if”), and else to perform different actions based on certain conditions.__

**Here’s a simple example:**

````python
age = 18

if age < 18:
    print("You are a minor.")
elif age < 60:
    print("You are an adult.")
else:
    print("You are a senior citizen.")
````
