## Loops

### The for loops

For loop in Python iterates over an iterable object such as a list:

````python
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
````

### The While Loop

A while loop continues to execute as long as a certain condition is true:

````python
count = 0

while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1  # Equivalent to 'count = count + 1'
````
